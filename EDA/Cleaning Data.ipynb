    "* There does not appear to be a relationship between the mean home price in a district and the district’s share of working age population.\n",
    "* Surprisingly, there is little to no correlation between price and the school variables. The school variables however are highly correlated with each other, indicating that we would not want to use all of them in a linear regression model due to multicollinearity.\n",

    "* raions that have a top 25 cultural object have a median home sale price that is higher by 1.2 million (using this feature as a factor)\n",
